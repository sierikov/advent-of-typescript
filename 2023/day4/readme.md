# Christmas Present Delivery Addresses

<..redacted..>

Today's task is to craft a type (`PresentDeliveryList`) that takes an object type as an input and then replaces the values at each property with an `Address`. We don't know in advance what properties will be provided, which is why it needs to be a generic type. Otherwise Bernard would probably just copy/pasta it to get through the day.
